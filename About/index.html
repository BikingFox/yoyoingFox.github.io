    <h3>What's with the name?</h3>
    <p>I'm sure your wondering were a name like "Slow Poke Computers" came from.  Here is
    the quick background story.  My nephew and I were working on my grampa's computer, 
    and we were moving computers and parts between my house and his house with a wagon.
    When we got to his house, he laughed and called us slow poke computers.  And that's were
    the name and logo came from.</p>
